story text-game

Big picture: the game revolves around the user's choices like the butterfly effect

steps
when users play ths game they can have different types of scenarios as well as different types of outcomes
the first step for the game was to make the user put in ther name, they then are told that they are sent on a mission. After that every thing that they type will change the game's next event. For example, if the user goes on the left path rather than the right path, then they might have less obstcales to jump over
other steps are to make the conditional statements for each scenario, and the scenario would need to be set to the same input as shown in the code.

Testing
My testing plan was to make each scenario enabled when the uer played this game. I tested this project by doing a different action, in order to see if it worked.

Revision
I realized that some of the functions were not going to work for this game, so i had to map out each event and make the code branch out, just like how i planned it
